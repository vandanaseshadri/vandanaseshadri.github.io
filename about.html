              My name is Vandana (she/her), and I'm a visual artist and analyst based in Dallas, TX.
              I have a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin.

              I've been doing <a href="/">traditional analog artwork</a>, like pencil drawing and oil/watercolor painting ever since I was little,
              and I continued my passion for artwork in college through <a href=/">
              Texas Visual Arts Collective</a>, a student organization I co-founded and directed. I specialize in small-scale analog artwork, 
              primarily working in watercolor, graphite, and pen/ink.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using a design thinking framework, I think about how to create products and experiences to solve problems. Iâ€™ve developed creative solutions 
              for university students and gathered user research in my current role as an analyst at <a href="https://iqvia.com">IQVIA</a>. 
              Outside of my career, I like to knit, write, indulge in internet/pop culture, and spend lots of time in the Texas sun.
