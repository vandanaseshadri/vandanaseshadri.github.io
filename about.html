              My name is Vandana (she/her), and I'm a creative person based in Dallas, TX.
              I have a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin.

              I've been doing <a href="index.html">traditional analog artwork</a>, like pencil drawing and oil/watercolor painting ever since I was little,
              and I continued my passion for artwork in college through <a href=
              "https://thedailytexan.com/2021/05/02/ut-austin-student-art-organization-seeks-to-raise-awareness-for-social-justice-issues/">
              Texas Visual Arts Collective</a>, a student organization I co-founded and directed. After graduating, I've kept a regular creative practice; you can
              follow along <a href="#">here</a>!

              I'm currently working at <a href="https://iqvia.com">IQVIA</a> as a data analyst. I'm also an aspiring user researcher/product designer in the tech space.
              Outside of work and art, I like to swim, go on walks, play tennis, and indulge in pop culture.

              I’m Vandana, a visual artist, data analyst, and aspiring designer based in Dallas, Texas.
              I specialize in small-scale analog artwork, primarily working in watercolor, graphite, and pen/ink.
            <p class="abt">
              Using a design thinking framework, I think about how to create products and experiences to solve problems.
              I’ve developed creative solutions for university students and gathered user research in my current role as an analyst at
              IQVIA.

              Outside of my career, I like to knit, write, and spend lots of time in the Texas sun.
